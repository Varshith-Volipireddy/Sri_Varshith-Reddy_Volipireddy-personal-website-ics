            <strong>Book: "Rise & Ruin"</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/Rise-Ruin-Aryan-Varshith-Reddy/dp/8196414064" target="_blank">Check it out on Amazon</a>
            <p> "For as long as he could remember, Edgar had always wanted more. And now he has his chance to get it.
              In the city of Kelria, wealth is power. Merchant houses hold sway over the city, enforcing their will like gangs. 
              Anarchy rules one half of the city, avarice the other. Smoke clouds the sky as an industrial revolution begins, steel the new gold of the city.
              Edgar had always wanted more. For years he'd envied the deep pockets of the merchants,
              and now he had his chance to take it for himself. A chance at glory, wealth and power. In a daring attempt, Edgar joins Silvio and Lucio, 
              his closest friends and decides to take what he wants and pulls off one of Kelria's most daring robberies in ages.
              Alvaro is a nobleman turned inspector, the second son of the mighty House Reyes. 
              Even though he's one of the most successful inspectors of the city, he's unsatisfied with his job. 
              Catching petty criminals is not what he thought he would be doing when he forsook his family fortune. 
              But the news of an audacious robbery of one of Kelria's great houses that shook the city to its core might be just what he's looking for." <br>

              Process: <br> 
              Reading has been an important part of my life. I decided to co-author a novel in order to further my
              passion for reading and enjoyment for writing. Successive lockdowns gave me an opportunity to do this.
              The writing process, initially free flowing, began to grow challenging yet I came to enjoy rising up to this.
              Handling the publishing process entirely on our own was a difficult experience. From the cover to proof
              reading and setting the price- we worked on every step. This experience allowed me to explore my
              creativity to its fullest, while teaching me to collaborate.

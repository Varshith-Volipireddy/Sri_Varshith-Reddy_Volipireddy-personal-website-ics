        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p>Movies have always been more than just entertainment for me â€” they're a way of seeing the world through a different lens. From the nuances of cinematography and lighting to the rhythm of editing and storytelling, I love breaking down every element of film. Whether it's a slow-burn character study or a high-concept sci-fi epic, I'm there for all of it.</p>
        <p>This passion led me to co-create a film review blog during college called <strong>The Real Critics</strong>, where I share thoughts, analysis, and reviews with fellow film lovers.</p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>It's a space where I can freely express my admiration for great storytelling and occasionally rant about the ones that miss the point. From Kubrick to Kurosawa, Nolan to small scale A24 films â€” we dive into it all.</p>

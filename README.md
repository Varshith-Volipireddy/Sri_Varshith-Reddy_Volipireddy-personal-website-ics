 Personal website for ICS 
 This is a personal website I've made for the Extra Credit Assignment.
 It consists of a homepage, which contains information regarding me, my writing, what I am doing currently, clubs im in at Ashoka, and the bye button.
 this contains links to my book, my writing process, it's blurb, and links to the clubs im in here - along with brief descriptions. 
 It also contains 3 subpages linked inside - Interests,Gallery and Contact.
 The interests page contains links and info regarding my interest in media, movies, books I've read and My spotify playlists. 
 The Gallery contains images in a grid format , these are scenes from some of my favourite movies - art that inspires me. 
 Contact is just a way for me to create a button and include my email address.
 Clone the repo or download or all the HTML files in then paste the path to run the website. 
 The directory structure consists of the project, with a public folder,all the html pages(index- homepage, contact,gallery and movies) along with this README.
 The Public folder consists of styles(named it this instead of css accidentally) for the css files, assets for my image and scripts for the javascript file. 
 Below are zoomed out images containing the webpage itself.
